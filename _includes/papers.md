    <p class="abstract">
    This dissertation studies the relative expressive power and properties of several fixpoint and second-order logics. We use the term fixpoint logic in a broad sense, referring to any logic which can encode some type of recursion, iteration or repetition.
    Our main objective is to systematically identify several important logics as precise fragments of other well-known logics. In order to accomplish this task, we develop automata-theoretic tools to analyze these fragments. The results of this dissertation provide new insight on the relationship of fixpoint and second-order logic and provides further evidence of the successful logic-automata connection.</p></h5>

    <p class="abstract">We introduce a new class of parity automata which, on trees, captures the expressive power of weak chain logic. This logic is a variant of monadic second-order logic which quantifies over finite chains. Using this new tool, we show that the bisimulation-invariant fragment of weak chain logic is equivalent to propositional dynamic logic.</p></h5>

    <p class="abstract">It is well known that Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) can
      be seen as a fragment of the modal \(\mu\)-calculus. In this paper we provide
      an exact syntactic characterization of the fragments of the \(\mu\)-calculus
      that correspond to PDL and to test-free PDL. In addition we give
      automata-theoretic characterizations for PDL, with and without tests, which
      shed light on the relation between these logics and the modal \(\mu\)-calculus
      and provide a new framework for the development of the theory of
      PDL.</p></h5>

    <p class="abstract">We prove that the bisimulation-invariant fragment of weak
      monadic second-order logic (WMSO) is equivalent to the fragment of the modal
      \(\mu\)-calculus where the application of the least fixpoint operator \(\mu
      p.\varphi\) is restricted to formulas \(\varphi\) that are continuous in p. Our
      proof is automata-theoretic in nature; in particular, we introduce a class of
      automata characterizing the expressive power of WMSO over tree models of
      arbitrary branching degree. The transition map of these automata is defined
      in terms of a logic \(FOE^\infty_1\) that is the extension of first-order logic
      with a generalized quantifier \(\exists^\infty\), where \(\exists^\infty
      x.\varphi\) means that there are infinitely many objects satisfying \(\varphi\).
      An important part of our work consists of a model-theoretic analysis of
      \(FOE^\infty_1\).</p></h5>

    <p class="abstract">Three important results about the expressivity of a modal
      logic L are the Characterization Theorem (that identifies a modal logic L as
      a fragment of a better known logic), the Definability Theorem (that provides
      conditions under which a class of L-models can be defined by a formula or a
      set of formulas of L), and the Separation Theorem (that provides conditions
      under which two disjoint classes of L-models can be separated by a class
      definable in L). We provide general conditions under which these results can
      be established for a given choice of model class and modal language whose
      expressivity is below first order logic. Besides some basic constraints that
      most modal logics easily satisfy, the fundamental condition that we require
      is that the class of \(\omega\)-saturated models in question has the
      Hennessy-Milner property with respect to the notion of observational
      equivalence under consideration. Given that the Characterization,
      Definability and Separation theorems are among the cornerstones in the model
      theory of L, this property can be seen as a test that identifies the adequate
      notion of observational equivalence for a particular modal logic.</p></h5>

    <p class="abstract">In epistemic logic, dynamic operators describe the
      evolution of the knowledge of participating agents through communication, one
      of the most basic forms of communication being public announcement.
      Semantically, dynamic operators correspond to transformations of the
      underlying model. While metatheoretic results on dynamic epistemic logic so
      far are largely limited to the setting of Kripke models, there is evident
      interest in extending its scope to non-relational modalities capturing, e.g.,
      uncertainty or collaboration. We develop a generic framework for
      non-relational dynamic logic by adding dynamic operators to coalgebraic
      logic. We discuss a range of examples and establish basic results including
      bisimulation invariance, complexity, and a small model property.</p></h5>

    <p class="abstract">Satisfiability problem for modal logic K augmented with
      quantifier-free Presburger and regularity constraints (EML) is known to be
      PSPACE-complete. In this paper, we consider its extension with nonregular
      constraints and more specifically those expressed by visibly pushdown
      languages (VPL). This class of languages is known to behave nicely, in
      particular when combined with Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). By extending
      EML, we show that decidability is preserved if we allow at most one positive
      VPL at each modal depth. By contrast, the presence of two VPL-contraints at
      the same modal depth or the presence of a negative occurrence of a single
      VPL-constraint leads to undecidability. This contrasts with decidability of
      PDL augmented with VPL-constraints.</p></h5>

      is specified in terms of relational models enriched with additional data
      structure to represent a memory. The logical language includes a collection
      of operations to access and modify the data structure. In this paper we study
      basic model properties of memory logics, and prove results concerning
      characterization, definability and interpolation. While the first two
      properties hold for all memory logics introduced in this article,
      interpolation fails in most cases.</p></h5>

      the Characterization and Definability theorems. We develop a general theory
      for modal logics below first order (in terms of expressivity) which exposes
      the following result: Characterization and Definability theorems hold for
      every (reasonable) modal logic whose omega-saturated models have the
      Hennessy-Milner property. The results are presented in a general version
      which is relativized to classes of models.</p></h5>
